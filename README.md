# noWord
non-WYSIWYG document generator.

The idea behind the project is to provide a very efficient text processing
framework for software developers or other IT professionals offering the following features:
  * command line user interface (no GUI) for extrem productivity
  * source files are exclusivly plain text files (git-able, pull-request, etc)
  * strict seperation between content and layout
  * foundation for complexe document generation task (not included in this project)
  * easy indexing of documents in noSql databases

The first two points make it very easy to integrate the noWord processor in any
software development environment (IDE, source code, build chain) which
makes it very convinent for software developers.

The following illustration outlines the main components of the noWord system.

## Input files

### doc_info.yaml
This files contains global settings of the document like:
* doc id, version, author, etc
* templates
* processing instructions

### Content files
As content file format we chose YAML over json for it's multiline support.
The content file is organized in blocks. Each block is a dictionary which should have
at least one entry: type. All other entries are block type specific.

```YAML
- type    : chapter
  title   : Some title

- type    : text
  content : >
    Some multiline text ...
    Another line

- type    : list
  content :
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
```
Build-in block types:
  * chapter
  * text
  * newpage
  * list
  * table
  * image
  * ...

## Application modules

### Block type Plugins
You can define your own block types using the plugin mecanism.

### Templates
For maximum flexibility, you can write you own templates using python.

## Testing

### Functional Testing
For each plugin a functional test was implemented. The following document
describes the functional test:
